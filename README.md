# macos-powertools
SysAdmin and developer tools written specifically for MacOS.

The tools are written in a variety of languages, each with their own respective
trade-offs and constraints.

At time of writing, the Python and shell tools are generally production ready,
whereas the Golang and Rust equivalents have various degrees of quality/flux.
